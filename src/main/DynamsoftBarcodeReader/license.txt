1. DEFINITIONS
"Application" means an end user program that LICENSEE develops using the Software and into which the Redistributables are incorporated, and which contains significant additional functionality over and above the functionality contained in the Software.
"Client Device" is defined as a unique client-side hardware device (e.g., a mobile phone, a tablet or a desktop PC) that accesses the Software if the Software is a mobile, desktop, or embedded application. For web applications, "Client Device" refers to a unique browser client that accesses the Software from one origin (i.e., same protocol, port, and hostname).
"LICENSEE" means the person or legal entity entering into this Agreement with Dynamsoft. Any person who is entering into this Agreement on behalf of an organizational entity represents that he or she has the authority to bind such entity.
"Redistributables" are those runtime libraries and files intended for duplication and distribution with the Application.
"Server" is defined as a computer configured with the intention of multiple users accessing it as a service, or as a background service running as an automated process. The computer has Software loaded into its RAM.
"Software" means the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader, Dynamsoft Document Normalizer, Dynamsoft Label Recognizer, Dynamsoft Code Parser, Dynamsoft Document Viewer software and all accompanying components, parts, and documentation that have been developed by Dynamsoft.
"Transaction" means a specific feature or capability of the Software, for example, barcodes scanned for Dynamsoft Barcode Reader, text characters recognized for Dynamsoft Label Recognizer, target regions detected for Dynamsoft Document Normalizer, or strings parsed for Dynamsoft Coder Parser. 
2. GRANT OF LICENSE 
Dynamsoft Corporation grants you a nonexclusive and limited license to use the Software products and functionalities for which you have paid the applicable fees solely for your internal business purposes and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Software is licensed, not sold, to you. If you acquire or are provided with any directories, components, connectors, utilities, data, or other items from Dynamsoft for use with the Software (the "Additional Software"), your use of the Additional Software shall be in accordance with the terms, conditions, obligations and restrictions of this Agreement. The term "Software" as used herein, shall be deemed to include the Additional Software and Third Party Products.
2.1 INSTALLATION AND USE
You may install and use the Software only in the configuration and for the number of licenses acquired by you. In order to exercise your rights to the Software under this License Agreement you must activate your copy of the Software in the manner described during the launch sequence. Dynamsoft may control the number and type of licenses and the use of the Software by key codes.
2.2 EVALUATION LICENSE 
An Evaluation License may be used only for the number and type of licenses specified and for the period specified on the Software packaging, ordering, or shipping documentation. Upon expiration of such specified period, the Software associated with an Evaluation License will not function unless  LICENSEE has obtained applicable full license keys. If the ordering or shipping documentation specifies a particular project, the Software may be used only with that project.  
An Evaluation License may only be used for evaluation or testing purposes and may not be used for production deployment purposes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Software provided under an Evaluation License are provided "AS-IS" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. An Evaluation License may be terminated by Dynamsoft Corporation upon written notice at any time.
2.3 DEPLOYMENT LICENSE
A Deployment License allows copying, deployment, and distribution of the Redistributables to end users, without further distribution, as part of the Application for LICENSEE's internal business purposes, not for resale to external customers.
Unless otherwise stated in a duly executed agreement, annual subscription licenses will be valid for one year beginning with the license activation date. LICENSEE can extend licenses for additional one-year periods (each a "Renewal Term").

The Deployment Licenses is on a per Application basis with the following possible licensing options available:
(a)	Per Transaction License
Per Transaction License is available for the Software. 
For example, with a Per Transaction License for Dynamsoft Barcode Reader, the Software can be used for a given number of unique barcode scans. If the Software is used to scan an image with four unique barcodes, it will be counted as four Transactions. When continuously scanning barcodes from a video stream, duplicated codes will be counted as one Transaction.
(b)	Per Client Device
Once a Client Device uses the Software, it would consume a license seat. Corresponding to the license option - Daily, Monthly, or Quarterly Active Client Device - chosen, a Client Device that has not accessed any functionality of the Software for a consecutive one-day, one-month, or one-quarter period is considered inactive. The license seat consumed by an inactive Client Device will be automatically released and available for use by any other Client Device.
(c)	Per Server License
A Per Server License option is available for on-premise server deployments of the Application. For each production, staging, testing, or development server that runs the Software, a one-server license seat is required. A server license may be limited to a specified number of CPU Cores. For more information regarding the CPU Core limitations and other details, please contact our sales team at sales@dynamsoft.com.
For cloud deployment, please contact sales@dynamsoft.com for more flexible options.
(d)	Per Application License
A Per Application license option that allows unlimited distributions of an Application, is available as well. For more info about this license option, please send your detailed project requirements to sales@dynamsoft.com for a quote.
(e)	Other Deployment Licenses
Custom deployment license options are available upon request. Please inquire at sales@dynamsoft.com.
2.4 OEM, ASP/SERVICE BUREAU AND OTHERS
LICENSEE must execute a separate agreement prior to making any commercial deployment of the Application to third-party end users, either directly or through distribution channels. This may happen when LICENSEE acts as an ISV, OEM, ASP/service bureau, or solution provider offering the Application to the public.
Applicable and additional licensing options can be discussed with sales@dynamsoft.com.
